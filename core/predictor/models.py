    Predictor Model

    This Django model represents a predictor for assisted reproductive technology outcomes.
    It contains various medical parameters relevant to fertility assessments and prediction of success probabilities for individual patients.

    Attributes:
    - patient (ForeignKey): A reference to the associated patient, linked to the Profile model in the accounts app.
    - female_age (FloatField): The age of the female patient in years.
    - AMH (FloatField): Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone level, a marker for ovarian reserve.
    - FSH (FloatField): Follicle-stimulating hormone level, indicative of ovulatory function.
    - no_embryos (FloatField): The number of embryos retrieved during the procedure.
    - endoendometrial_tickness (FloatField): Thickness of the endometrium, important for implantation.
    - sperm_count (FloatField): Total sperm count available for fertilization.
    - sperm_morphology (FloatField): Quality of sperm morphology as assessed under a microscope.
    - follicle_size (FloatField): Average size of the ovarian follicles, crucial for ovulation timing.
    - no_of_retrieved_oocytes (FloatField): Number of oocytes retrieved during the egg retrieval process.
    - qality_of_embryo (FloatField): Quality assessment of the embryos.
    - quality_of_retrieved_oocytes_MI (FloatField): Quality assessment of retrieved oocytes at the metaphase I stage.
    - quality_of_retrieved_oocytes_MII (FloatField): Quality assessment of retrieved oocytes at the metaphase II stage.
    - result (FloatField): The final result of the prediction model.
    - success_probability (FloatField): The predicted probability of success for the treatment, defaults to 0 if not set.
    - created_date (DateTimeField): Timestamp for when the predictor record was created, auto-filled upon creation.

    Methods:
    - __str__(): Returns a string representation of the predictor instance, including the patient and results.
    - get_absolute_api_url(): Returns the API endpoint URL for accessing details of the predictor instance.

    Usage:
    This model can be utilized within a fertility clinic's application to record and analyze predictors of treatment success, enabling personalized patient care and informed decision-making.
